Changed Showtimes class variable -Screen: int to -screen:Screen to show the relation.
Not sure if -title should be referencing Movie class or not (-title: Movie).

Added Schedule Class so seats can be removed and accounted for for each instance of movie for each different time.

Added Transaction Class to be able to
