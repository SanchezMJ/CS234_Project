Created Classes for:
Customer
Schedule
Screen
Seating

Customer
set it up to have attributes customer information
constructor with no arguments will have attributes set to guest
Will use DOB to pull age in case we use for age restricted movies
Plan on using a point system

Screen
defined attributes for screen

Seating
Will use a particular array depending on which type 
the screen is set to.  IMAX vs a regular screen.

Schedule
Added this thinking it would be easier to create an ArrayList holding
a different times for each movie.  This way, the seating array can movidified
for each instance of a movie.  Thinking this might allow an easier wa 
for report seats sold for each movie as well.

Added relationship lines.
